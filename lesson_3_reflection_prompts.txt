When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I will do that when I am working remotely, not having my computer and it is possible to add the file directly without 
    use ofa ny specific software installed in my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This is because when ever I make a change, that should always be reflected in my computer
    Irrespective of whether I am connected to a internet network.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forking transports the contents of one github repository to another directly, whereas cloning makes copies of contents
    of one directory to other in a local machine or a romote repository. In case of branching we create a version of files keeping the 
    original in a local machne and both the main and the branch can be comitted later.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It will help in tracking all the changesmade by several contributors.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    We can collaborete without using github or git, through using other collaboraing tools lile E-Mail etc.
    However tracking changes done by individuals will be challenging.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
